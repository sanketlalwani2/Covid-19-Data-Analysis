# Covid-19-Analysis

## Overview
This project involves the analysis of COVID-19 data using PySpark in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The objective is to identify patterns and insights related to COVID-19 cases, such as the impact of different factors (age, sex, pre-existing conditions, etc.) on the outcomes of the cases.

## Data Source
The data used in this analysis is sourced from [source_name], which provides daily updates on the status of COVID-19 cases globally. The dataset includes details such as patient age, sex, medical unit, type of patient, and outcomes.

## Features
- `USMER`: Medical unit identifier
- `SEX`: Patient's sex
- `AGE`: Patient's age
- `PNEUMONIA`: Indicator if the patient had pneumonia
- `DIABETES`: Indicator if the patient had diabetes
- `COPD`: Indicator if the patient had Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
- `ASTHMA`: Indicator if the patient had asthma
- `OBESITY`: Indicator if the patient was obese
- And other medical indicators.

## Analysis
The notebook conducts several analyses:
1. Data preprocessing including handling missing values and outliers.
2. Statistical summaries to understand the distribution and relationships of various features.
3. Advanced visualizations to represent the impact of COVID-19 on different population segments.
4. Predictive modeling to forecast outcomes based on the available data.

## How to Run
To run this project:
1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Navigate to the project directory and start Jupyter Notebook.
4. Open the `Covid-19 Analysis.ipynb` file.
5. Run the cells sequentially to see the analysis and results.
